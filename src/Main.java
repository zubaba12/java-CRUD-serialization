//        You should strive to have at least 10 commits in your git log by the end of this challenge.

//        When you're done head over to https://github.com and follow this tutorial to set up SSH authentication
//        Once you have an SSH key linked to your local machine create a new github repository called java-CRUD-serialization. The repository should be public. Don't select the option to add a README (it'll mess up your upload).
//        Check out the photo below to see how to copy your repository ssh-url, find it in your new repo and add it to your project in intelliJ by opening the terminal and putting in the command
//        git remote add origin _____ replacing the _____ with the url you copied from github.
//        Once that is connected you should be able to run the command git push origin master from your IntelliJ and send your files to github!
//        Refresh your github project window and you should see your files.
//        (if this part doesn't work no worries, we'll show the github process next week)
//        Slack me your repository on github when you're done
